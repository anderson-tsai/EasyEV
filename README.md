Electric vehicles are inevitably the future of transportation. However, the novelty of electric vehicles may cause uncertainty. EasyEV is a website made to inform the uninformed about electric vehicles, and to guide the interested into finding their electric vehicle that suits all their needs. The website contains a personalized questionnaire to evaluate the needs of an individual, and shows them the the three most suitable electric vehicles given their responses. The user can then compare the specifications of the vehicles, and find the one that they prefer most.
