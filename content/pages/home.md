subtitle: Simplify your transition to EVs!
accordion:
  - description: It is true that the source of electricity does stem from polluting sources, however, electric vehicles create flexibility in the choice between these polluting options and renewable sources, while this flexibility does not exist with gas vehicles. If we were to stick with gas vehicles, there would be no opportunity to transition to a cleaner and more sustainable future.
    title: Isn't electricity produced from sources that produce carbon?
  - description: Although carbon footprint of the initial production of an electric vehicle may be larger than its gas vehicle equivalent, the overall lifetime carbon footprint of the electric vehicle is still substantially better. For reference, the graph above (https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change) shows the overall carbon emissions produced throughout the lifecycle of a typical European gas car, a hybrid Toyota Prius Eco, and an all-electric Nissan Leaf.
    title: Isn't the production of electric vehicles more harmful to the environment than gas vehicles?
  - title: What is Range Anxiety and should I be worried about it?
    description: Range Anxiety is the fear that an electric car will run out of battery and be unable to reach a charging station. In rare instances, this could be a possibility similar to gas vehicles running out of gas. However, as time goes on, battery technology and electric charging station infrastructure advances, this issue will be alleviated. In the figure above (https://evadoption.com/ev-charging-stations-statistics), it shows that the number of electric cars are being adopted at an exponential rate and the number of charging stations are also being built at a quicker rate to support the growing number of electric cars. Many car companies are dedicated to increasing the number of charging stations through companies such as EVgo and ChargePoint, as well as Tesla building out its own network of Superchargers.  
  - title: What is MPGe?
    description: MPGe is the equivalent of Miles Per Gallon in terms of electric cars and describes the efficiency of the vehicle. 1 MPGe is about 1 mile per 33.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh). A kilowatt-hour is a measure of energy usage and is commonly used when describing electric cars.  
  - title: What is a frunk?
    description: A Front Trunk! Electric cars don't have engines, so car companies will oftentimes utilize the extra space in the form of a trunk at the front of the vehicle for additional storage. 
  - title: What features should I look for in buying EVs? What kind of EV is best?
    description: Typically, the most important factors in buying electric cars are the range, charging infrastructure and speed, in addition to other essential car features such as interior, seats, design, and safety. Oftentimes, it will come down to what you use the vehicle for - whether it be for short work commutes, long travels, or to take advantage of lightning quick acceleration!
